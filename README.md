# ghfollowers

This is the project that I built to learn the foundamental of iOS development. This is my version of the code from SAllen0400's course. I don't use the storyboards to build the UI, but I add programmatically all my elements.
**swift**, **uikit**, **iOS**, 

### Overview
* The app use the github API.
* A user enters the name of someone for whom they wish to look for followers.
* A user then sees the list of followers belonging to the entered username. The list has the pagination.
* It's possible filter on the list of the follower.
* The user has the ability to favorite the current username using the plus button in the upper right corner.
* For any user it's possible to see the user info like followers and repo.
* User sees favorited users on the second tab. With a swipe on the item it's possibile to delete the user from the favorites list.
* There is a custom dialog alert.
